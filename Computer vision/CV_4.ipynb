    "5. Does a batch normalization layer have any trainable parameters ?\n",
    " \n",
    "6. In batch normalization during preparation, what statistics are used to normalize? What about during the validation process ?\n",

    "8.Explain between MAX POOLING and AVERAGE POOLING is number eight ?\n",
    " \n",
    "9. What is the purpose of the POOLING LAYER ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps. Thus, it reduces the number of parameters to learn and the amount of computation performed in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling layer summarises the features present in a region of the feature map generated by a convolution layer.\n",
